# Animal Identifier Project

## **Requirements**

To run the Animal Identifier project, you will need the following:

- **Python 3.6+**
- **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** (to run pre-trained models)
- **OpenCV** (for camera access)
- **ImageNet-pretrained model** or a **custom-trained model** for animal classification

## **Steps to Build the Animal Identifier**

### **1. Install Required Libraries**

First, install the necessary libraries by running the following command:

```bash

pip install tensorflow opencv-python

```

## **Running the Code**
Save the code to a file named, for example, animal_identifier.py.

Run it with:


```bash
python animal_identifier.py
```
**Press ‘q’ to quit the camera feed**


To run this animal identifier project in Windows, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Python on Windows
Download Python from the official website and install it.
During installation, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH".
Verify the installation by opening Command Prompt (search for cmd in Start) and typing:
```bash
python --version
```
2. Install Required Libraries
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and install the required packages (tensorflow and opencv-python) by running:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python
```
This will install TensorFlow and OpenCV, necessary for model loading and camera access.

3. Access Your Camera
Windows may prompt you to grant permission for the camera when running OpenCV. Be sure to allow access when prompted.

4. Run the Script
Save the code provided above to a file, such as animal_identifier.py.

Open Command Prompt, navigate to the folder where animal_identifier.py is located:

```bash
cd path\to\your\file
```
Run the script with:

```bash
python animal_identifier.py
```
